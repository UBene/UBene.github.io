[ScopeFoundry](https://www.scopefoundry.org) is an open source platform for controlling custom laboratory experiments and visualizing scientific data developed at the [Molecular Foundry](https://foundry.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. 



During my time as a visiting student at the Molecular Foundry, I contributed on expanding the core abilities as well as a full deployement on home build time resolved photoluminescence microscope.
